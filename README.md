<h1> VMware has ended active development of this project, this repository will no longer be updated.</h1><br>[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/pivotal-cf/docs-bookbinder.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/pivotal-cf/bookbinder) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-cf/bookbinder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-cf/bookbinder)
# Bookbinder

**Note**: The Bookbinder gem is now named `bookbindery`, and this GitHub repository is no longer a supported gem source for the gem. To use the Bookbinder gem, include the following in your book's Gemfile:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'bookbindery'
```

Bookbinder is a gem that binds together a unified documentation web application
from disparate source material.
Source material can be in markdown, HTML, or
[DITA](http://dita.xml.org/standard), and must be stored in local directories or
in git repositories.
Bookbinder runs [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) to produce a Rack app
that you can deploy to Cloud Foundry.

See the [Bookbinder wiki](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/wiki) for detailed information and instructions, such as how to configure [credentials for multiple git services](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/wiki/Credentials-for-multiple-git-services).

## Installation

**Note**: Bookbinder requires Ruby version 2.0.0-p195 or higher.

Follow the instructions below to install Bookbinder:

1. Add `gem "bookbindery"` to your Gemfile.
1. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies specified in your Gemfile.

1. (**Optional**) Install the [DITA Open Toolkit](http://www.dita-ot.org/)
    (DITA-OT).

    Bookbinder uses the [DITA Open Toolkit](http://www.dita-ot.org/) (DITA-OT)
    to process documents written in DITA.
    If you have DITA sections in your book, you must install DITA-OT to process
    them.

    Once installed, specify the location of the DITA-OT library as an
    environment variable named **PATH_TO_DITA_OT_LIBRARY**.

    We recommend that you use the `full_easy_install` type for the DITA-OT
    library.

    **Note**: Ensure that the version of the DITA-OT library that you install
    supports the DITA version in which your documents are written.

## Usage

Bookbinder is meant to be used from within a project called a **book**.
The book includes a configuration file that describes which documentation
repositories to use as source materials.

The bookbindery gem provides a set of scripts to aggregate those repositories
and publish them to various locations.

Bookbinder also provides scripts for running on a Continuous Integration system
that can detect when a documentation repository has been updated with new
content, and that can verify a composed book is free of any dead links.

### Creating a Book

1. To create a new book on your local machine, run `bookbinder generate
    BOOKNAME`, replacing BOOKNAME with the name of your book. For example:

    ```
    $ bundle exec bookbinder generate cloud-documentation
    ```

    The `bookbinder generate BOOKNAME` command creates a directory named
    `BOOKNAME`.
    This directory contains the following:
    * A Gemfile referencing the `bookbindery` gem
    * A minimal `config.yml` file
    * A `bin` directory containing code
    * A `master_middleman/source` directory containing an index page
    * An empty `master_middleman/build/` directory

1. After running `bookbinder generate`, run `bookbinder bind local` to assemble
    your book from the repos specified in the `config.yml` file.

    **Note**: At this point, unless you've added anything to the `config.yml`,
    the `config.yml` contains no references to any repos, and so bookbinder will
    bind a book with no content.

1. Run the following commands to start up the web site locally:
    * `cd final_app`
    * `rackup`

1. Launch a web browser to `http://localhost:9292/` to view your book.

As typically used, the disparate source materials of a book are organized into
separate git repositories.

When writing documentation on your local machine, however, we recommend that you
add uncommitted changes to the preview web site that you serve on your machine.

The `bind local` command performs this operation by gathering local sections
from sibling directories of your book.
These sections' directories must have the same name as their remote git
repositories, but don't need to be git repositories for all commands.

### Deploying your Book
- Create an AWS bucket for green builds and put info into `credentials.yml`
- Set up CF spaces for staging and production and put details into `credentials.yml`
- Deploy to production
- (Optional) Register your sitemap with Google Webmaster Tools

### A More Exhaustive config.yml Example

```YAML
book_repo: org-name/repo-name
cred_repo: org-name/private-repo
layout_repo: org-name/master-middleman-repo

sections:
  - repository:
      name: org-name/bird-repo
      ref: 165c28e967d58e6ff23a882689c953954a7b588d
    directory: birds
    subnav_template: cool-sidebar-partial		# optional
  - repository:
      name: org-name/reptile-repo
      ref: d07101dec08a698932ef0aa2fc36316d6f7c4851
    directory: reptiles
    subnav_name: my_subnav						# optional

subnavs:										# optional
  - name: my_subnav
    topics:
    - title: My Nav Section
      base_path: birds/robins
      toc_path:  egg/index
      toc_nav_name: My Nav Overview
    - title: Other Nav Section
      base_path: reptiles
      toc_path:  index

subnav_exclusions:								# optional
  - .ignore-class
  - h2:contains("Table of Contents")

archive_menu:									# optional
  - v1.3.0.0
  - v1.2.0.0: archive-repo/your_pdf.yml

public_host: animals.example.com

template_variables:								# optional
  var_name: special-value
  other_var: 12

```

Assuming your book is in git, your `.gitignore` should contain the following
entries, which are directories generated by Bookbinder:

    output
    final_app

`master_middleman` is a directory which forms the basis of your site. [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) configuration and top-level assets, javascripts, and stylesheets should all be placed in here. You can also have ERB layout files. Each time a bind operation is run, this directory is copied to `output/master_middleman`. Then each section repo is copied (as a directory) into `output/master_middleman/source/`, before middleman is run to generate the final app.

`.ruby-version` is used by [Ruby version managers](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/ruby_version_management) to select the appropriate Ruby version for a given project.

### Using Multiple Configuration Files

Bookbinder now supports breaking the above config.yml across multiple files.

A non-empty config.yml is still required in the book's root directory, however you may optionally include any number of valid yaml files with config in a directory named `config`, which you will need to create. At runtime, configuration will be loaded from `config.yml` and any files matching `*.yml` in the `config` directory.

### Credentials Repository

The credentials repository should be a private repository, referenced in your `config.yml` as `cred_repo`. It contains `credentials.yml`, which must include your deployment credentials:

```YAML
aws:
  access_key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
  secret_key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYzEXAMPLEKEY
  green_builds_bucket: s3_bucket_name
cloud_foundry:
  username: sam
  password: pel
  api_endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io
  organization: documentation-team
  app_name: docs
  staging_space: docs-staging
  production_space: docs-production
  staging_host:
    cfapps.io:
      - staging-route-subdomain
      - another-staging-route-subdomain
  production_host:
    cfapps.io:
      - production-route-subdomain
```

### Layout Repository

If you specify a `layout_repo:` in `config.yml` with the full name of a git repository (e.g., `cloudfoundry/my-doc-layout`, which will default to GitHub), it will be downloaded for use as your book's `master_middleman` directory.

Any files included in your book's `master_middleman/source` directory will override files of the same name in the specified layout repository.

### Section Repository Ref

By default, the `bookbinder bind remote` command binds the most current versions (i.e., the `master` branch) of the documents in the git repositories specified by the `sections:` of your `config.yml`.

Bookbinder supports a `ref` key to enable use of an alternate version of a repo. The value of this key can be the name of a branch (e.g., `develop`), a SHA, or a tag (`v19`).

```
sections:
  - repository:
      name: org-name/bird-repo
      ref: my-branch
```

Example SHA:

```
sections:
  - repository:
      name: org-name/bird-repo
      ref: 165c28e967d58e6ff23a882689c953954a7b588d
```

**Note**: Bookbinder only uses the <code>ref</code> key when binding 'remote'. The <code>bookbinder bind local</code> command ignores the <code>ref</code> key.

## Supported Formats

* [Markdown](#user-content-markdown)
* [DITA](#user-content-dita)

### Markdown
All markdown sections must be specified within the section key of the `config.yml`.

### DITA

Specify the following in the `config.yml`:

* All DITA sections within the dita_sections key of the `config.yml`
* In either the first or in each (for multiple ditamaps) DITA section listed in the `config.yml`, a key-value pair "ditamap_location: my-ditamap.ditamap"
* (optional) In either the first or in each (for multiple ditamaps) DITA section listed in the `config.yml`, a key-value pair "ditaval_location: my-ditaval.ditaval"

For example:


```YAML
dita_sections:

  - repository:
      name: org-name/bird-repo
      ref: 165c28e967d58e6ff23a882689c953954a7b588d                #optional
    directory: birds
    ditamap_location: path/to/my-special-ditamap-location.ditamap
    ditaval_location: path/to/my-special-ditaval-location.ditaval  #optional

 - repository:
 	 name: org-name/dependent-section
 	 ref: 165c28e967d58e6ff23a882689c123998a7b577e                 #optional
    directory: dependent-section
	ditamap_location: path/to/other-ditamap.ditamap
	ditaval_location: path/to/other-ditamap.ditaval                 #optional
```

**Note**: You'll need to have properly installed and specified the [DITA-OT](#user-content-dita-ot) library.

## Middleman Templating Helpers

Bookbinder comes with a Middleman configuration that provides a handful of helpful functions, and should work for most book projects. To use a custom Middleman configuration instead, place a `config.rb` file in the `master_middleman` directory of the book project. This will overwrite Bookbinder's `config.rb`.

Bookbinder provides several helper functions that can be called from within an .erb file in a doc repo, such as a layout file.

### Quick Links
`<%= quick_links %>` produces a table of contents based on in-page anchors.

### Modified Date
`<%= modified_date %>` displays the most recent commit date for the file in the format 'Page last updated: September 1, 2015'. You can provide an optional date format, i.e. `<%= modified_date '%m/%d/%y'%>`.

### Breadcrumbs
`<%= breadcrumbs %>` generates a series of breadcrumbs as a UL HTML tag. The breadcrumbs go up to the site's top-level, based on the title of each page. The bottom-most entry in the list of breadcrumbs represents the current page; the rest of the breadcrumbs show the hierarchy of directories that the page lives in. Each breadcrumb above the current page is generated by looking at the [frontmatter](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/) title of the index template of that directory. If you'd like to use breadcrumb text that is different than the title, an optional 'breadcrumb' attribute can be used in the frontmatter section to override the title.

### Subnavs
`<%= yield_for_subnav %>` inserts the appropriate subnav based on each constituent repositories' `subnav_template:` or `subnav_name:` parameter in `config.yml`. For a given section, only one key should be used. If both keys are specified, bookbinder will default to using the subnav_template. 

The default template (`\_default.erb`) uses the label `default` and is applied to all sections unless another template is specified with subnav\_template or subnav\_name. Template labels are the name of the template file with extensions removed. ("sample" for a template named "sample.erb")

#### Subnav from Template (subnav_template):
If specified for a section, Bookbinder will look for a file of name <subnav-template>.erb in `master_middleman/source/subnavs` and insert this partial into the template at the code helper.

```YAML
sections:
  - repository:
      name: org-name/bird-repo
    directory: birds
    subnav_template: subnav-about-birds
```

If your book includes a dita_section, instead of providing a subnav_template, Bookbinder will look for a file `_dita_subnav_template.erb` from `master_middleman/source/subnavs`.

If your book generates any subnavs for dita_sections by specifying a `subnav_template`, Bookbinder makes subnav links available in a json format at `/subnavs/dita-subnav-props-<your-dita-section-directory>.json`. They could be consumed with a javascript library (e.g. React.js) to create your subnav. Bookbinder will have written the name of the file containing the links from _dita_subnav_template.erb at a data attribute called data-props-location on 'div.nav-content'.

An example of the json links:

```code
{
  "links":
  [
    {"url": "/dita-section-one/some-guide.html", "text": "my topic 1"},
    {"url": "/dita-section-one/../dita-section-dependency/some-guide-1.html", "text": "my topic dependency"}
  ]
}
```

#### Subnav from Config (subnav_name):
The `subnav_name` key allows users to generate their own navigation-related json by specifying topics in a `config.yml` and parsing the topic's specified table of contents page for navigation items, rather than defining as static HTML (as with `subnav_template`). This json can then be consumed with a javascript library (e.g. React.js) to create your subnav.

This feature not currently supported for DITA, though the `subnav_template` key does something very similar when used in dita_sections (see above).

**Requirements:**

* In `config.yml`: a `subnav_name` key for each section to display the generated subnav, and a `subnavs` section that defines each `subnav_name` (as key `name`) used for those sections.
* In `master_middleman/source/subnavs`, a file `subnav_template.erb` that contains html to which the generated subnav json will be appended. The file must contain one div with class 'nav-content'.
* Properly formatted table of contents file for each topic, as specified by key `toc_path`

```YAML
sections:
  - repository:
      name: org-name/bird-repo
    directory: birds
    subnav_name: my_subnav
  - repository:
      name: org-name/reptile-repo
    directory: reptiles
    subnav_name: my_subnav

subnavs:
  - name: my_subnav
    topics:
    - title: My Nav Section
      toc_path: birds/robins/index
      toc_nav_name: My Nav Overview
    - title: Other Nav Section
      toc_path: reptiles/index
```

**Keys:**

* `name`: Defines name of the subnav, to be used to associate to sections in config
* `topics`: Top-level items for subnav
	* `title`: Human-readable name of the topic, to be included in subnav
	* `toc_path`: Where the topic's Table of Contents file is found in the final app, without file extension. Usually this will be <section-directory>/index
	* `toc_nav_name`: Human-readable name of the table of contents page to be included in subnav. If not provided, a link to the TOC will still be added to the nav with name specified in `title`.

There is also an optional top-level key in `config.yml` that allows for manual exclusion of elements when parsing the file at toc_path to populate submenu items. Any valid Nokogiri css selector may be passed as an exclusion.

```YAML
subnav_exclusions:
  - .ignore-class
  - h2:contains("Table of Contents")
```

**Example Table of Contents page:**

The parser only looks for `h2` and `ul`/`ol` `li > a` elements on the specified toc_file for generating the subnav. Additionally, elements with class '.nav-exclude' will be ignored, along with any elements specified in the `config.yml`'s `subnav_exclusions` key.

An example Table of Contents file:

```Markdown
# Some Title

Some Introductory text

## Table of Contents

* [A Blue Generated Nav Item](./blue.html)

## Some Former H2

* [A Red Generated Nav Item](./red.html)

```

**Generated JSON:**

Upon binding, Bookbinder parses each of the toc_files specified in the config and specifies any `h2s` as unlinked subheaders and `ol`/`ul` with `li + a` as children navigation items. Topics will be added to the json file in first the order specified in the config, then in the order specified in the TOC file.

Bookbinder makes these subnav links available in a json format at `/subnavs/<your-subnav-name>.json`. It will have written the name of the file containing the links from subnav_template.erb at a data attribute called data-props-location on 'div.nav-content'.

An example of the json links using the config and TOC file included above:

```code
{
  "links":
  [
  	{"text": "My Nav Section", title: true},
    {"url": "/birds/robins/egg/index.html", "text": "My Nav Overview"},
    {"url": "/birds/robins/egg/blue.html", "text": "A Generated Nav Item From Link"},
    {"text": "Some Former H2"},
    {"url": "/birds/robins/egg/red.html", "text": "Another Generated Nav Item From Link"},
    {"text": "Other Nav Section", title: true},
    {"url": "/reptiles/index.html", "text": "Other Nav Section"}
  ]
}
```

### Code Snippets
`<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'my-org/code-repo', at: 'myCodeSnippetA' %>` inserts code snippets extracted from code repositories.

To delimit where a code snippet begins and ends, you must use the format of `code_snippet MARKER_OF_YOUR_CHOOSING start OPTIONAL_LANGUAGE`, followed by the code, and then finished with `code_snippet MARKER_OF_YOUR_CHOOSING end`:
If the `OPTIONAL_LANGUAGE` is omitted, your snippet will still be formatted as code but will not have any syntax highlighting.

Code snippet example:

```clojure

; code_snippet myCodeSnippetA start clojure
	(def fib-seq
   	  (lazy-cat [0 1] (map + (rest fib-seq) fib-seq)))
	user> (take 20 fib-seq)
	(0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181)
; code_snippet myCodeSnippetA end

```

### Archive Menu

Bookbinder allows you to specify a drop-down menu template for use in the navbar. This can contain links to PDFs or other archived versions of documentation. To specify a drop-down menu, add the `archive_menu` key in `config.yml` as follows:

```
  archive_menu:
    - v1.3.0.0
    - v1.2.0.0: my-pdf-repo/v1.2.0.0.pdf
```

The first key (e.g. v1.3.0.0) is available for use as a title in your navbar. You can configure the structure of the drop-down menu by creating a template in `master_middleman/source/archive_menus/_default.erb`.

Finally, to insert the archive menu, use the `<%= yield_for_archive_drop_down_menu %>` tag in the appropriate part of the navbar in your layout.erb.

### Template Variables

Bookbinder allows you to define **template variables** by adding key-value pairs to the `config.yml` file for your book.

To use a template variable, add the key to a source file.
When you then bind your book, Bookbinder replaces the key with the value defined in the `config.yml` file.

* To define a new template variable, add the key-value pair to the **template_variables** section of the  `config.yml` file.

    Example `config.yml` file excerpt:

    <pre>
    ...
    template_variables:
      app_domain: example.com
      my-app: < a href="http://my-app.example.org" >this link</a>
    </pre>

* To use a template variable, add the key (in <%=vars.MY-KEY%> form) to a source file.

    Example source file excerpt:

    <pre>
    I deployed my app to <%=vars.app_domain%>. You can see it by clicking <%=vars.my-app%>.
    </pre>


### Partials

Bookbinder supports **partials**, reusable blocks of source material.

Create a partial by adding a file containing source material to a repo.
The name of the file must start with an underscore.

To use the partial, use the name of the file without the starting underscore in the following code, and add this code to the source file where you want the partial to appear: <%= partial 'FILENAME' %>

### Including Assets

Bookbinder also includes helper code to correctly find image, stylesheet, and javascript assets. When using `<% image_tag ...`, `<% stylesheet_link_tag ...`, or `<% javascript_include_tag ...` to include assets, Bookbinder will search the entire directory structure starting at the top-level until it finds an asset with the provided name. For example, when resolving `<% image_tag 'great_dane.png' %>` called from the page `dogs/big_dogs/index.html.md.erb`, Middleman will first look in `images/great_dane.png.` If that file does not exist, it will try `dogs/images/great_dane.png`, then `dogs/big_dogs/images/great_dane.png`.

## Commands

Bookbinder's entry point is the `bookbinder` executable. It should be invoked from the book directory. The following commands are available:

### `bind` command

Bookbinder's most important command is `bind`. It takes one argument on the command line: `local` or `remote`.

        bin/bookbinder bind local

will find documentation repositories in directories that are siblings to your current directory.

        bin/bookbinder bind remote

will find doc repos by downloading the latest version from git. Note that if any of the repositories configured as 'sections' are private, you should [create an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) for Bookbinder from an account that has access to the section repositories.

You should `ssh-add` this key to give Bookbinder access to the repositories.

The bind command creates two output directories, one named `output/` and one named `final_app/`. These are placed in the current directory and are overwritten each time you run Bookbinder.

**Note**: When Bookbinder binds DITA sections of your book, it only sends error messages to the screen. Use the `--verbose` option with `bind` to see the non-filter output.

#### The `final_app` directory

`final_app/` contains Bookbinder's ultimate output: a Rack web-app that can be pushed to Cloud Foundry or run locally.

The Rack web-app will respect redirect rules specified in `redirects.rb`, so long as they conform to the `rack/rewrite` [syntax](https://github.com/jtrupiano/rack-rewrite). For example:

```ruby
rewrite   '/wiki/John_Trupiano',  '/john'
r301      '/wiki/Yair_Flicker',   '/yair'
r302      '/wiki/Greg_Jastrab',   '/greg'
r301      %r{/wiki/(\w+)_\w+},    '/$1'
```

#### The `output` directory

`output/` contains an intermediary state. This includes `output/master_middleman`, the final prepared directory that the `bind` script ran middleman against.

**Note**: As of version 0.2.0, the `bind` command no longer generates PDFs.

### `update_local_doc_repos` command

As a convenience, Bookbinder provides a command to update all your local doc repos, performing a git pull on each one:

        bin/bookbinder update_local_doc_repos

## Running the App Locally

    cd final_app
    bundle
    rackup

This will start a [rack](http://rack.github.io) server to serve your
documentation website locally at
[http://localhost:9292/](http://localhost:9292/). While making edits in
documentation repos, we recommend leaving this running in a dedicated shell
window. It can be terminated by hitting `ctrl-c`.

## Continuous Integration

### CI for books

The currently recommended tool for CI with Bookbinder is [GoCD](http://www.go.cd).

#### CI Runner
You will want a build that executes this shell command:

        bundle install --binstubs
        bin/bookbinder run_publish_ci

This will bind a book and push it to staging.

## Deploying

Bookbinder has the ability to deploy the finished product to either staging or production. The deployment scripts requires the Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI).

Download the cf CLI from [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases). For more information and instructions, see the [cf CLI documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/index.html).

### Setting up CF Apps

Each book should have a dedicated CF space and host for its staging and production servers.
The Cloud Foundry organization and spaces must be created manually and specified as values for "organization", "staging_space" and "production_space" in `config.yml`.
Upon the first and second deploy, bookbinder will create two apps in the space to which it is deploying. The apps will be named `"app_name"-blue` and `"app_name"-green`.  These will be used for a [blue-green deployment](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html) scheme.  Upon successful deploy, the subdomain of `cfapps.io` specified by "staging_host" or "production_host" will point to the most recently deployed of these two apps.


### Deploy to Staging
Deploying to staging is not normally something a human needs to do: the book's CI script does this automatically every time a build passes.

The following command will deploy the build in your local 'final_app' directory to staging:

        bin/bookbinder push_local_to_staging

### Deploy to Production
Deploying to prod is always done manually. It can be done from any machine with the book project checked out, but does not depend on the results from a local bind (or the contents of your `final_app` directory). Instead, it pulls the latest green build from S3, untars it locally, and then pushes it up to prod:

        bin/bookbinder push_to_prod <build_number>

If the build_number argument is left out, the latest green build will be deployed to production.

## Generating a Sitemap for Google Search Indexing

The sitemap file `/sitemap.xml` is automatically regenerated when binding. When setting up a new docs website, make sure to add this sitemap's url in Google Webmaster Tools (for better reindexing?).

## Contributing to Bookbinder

### Running Tests

To run bookbinder's rspec suite, install binstubs, then run the included rake task:

Once: `bundle install --binstubs`

Then at any time: `bin/rake`
